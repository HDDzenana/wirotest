Didn't use 'image' snippet which would provide better quality in order to have as many things in one place as possible.

For same reason didn't use grid, and one block on promo section. Also didn't want to use masonry library nor grid areas as it would probably make it unreadable :) 
As of now images are not scrollable - again in order to keep it clean, without any 3rd party apps (or in this case libraries).


Font sizes and family are regular Dawn fontsizes, due to having only read-only access to Figma.
